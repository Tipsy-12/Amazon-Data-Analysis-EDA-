# Project Report: Analysis of Product Details Data

## Introduction

This report provides an in-depth analysis of the dataset contained in the `Produxt_details.ipynb` notebook. The goal of this project was to examine various products and their performance metrics, with a focus on identifying actionable insights that can improve advertising strategies and product listings.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises information about different products, including their session percentages and unit session percentages. These metrics help evaluate the performance of product pages in terms of traffic and conversion rates.

### Columns in the Dataset

- **Title**: The name of the product.
- **ASIN**: Amazon Standard Identification Number, a unique identifier for each product.
- **Session %**: The percentage of total sessions that include at least one view of the product.
- **Unit Session %**: The percentage of sessions that resulted in a purchase of the product.

### Data Analysis and Functions Performed

#### Data Loading and Cleaning
- **Loading Data**: The dataset was loaded from the provided file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Any missing or malformed data was handled appropriately to ensure accuracy in the analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were calculated for session percentages and unit session percentages.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and box plots were used to visualize the distribution of these metrics across different products.

#### Data Visualization
- **Bar Charts**: Used to compare session percentages and unit session percentages across different products.
- **Scatter Plots**: Plotted session percentages against unit session percentages to identify any correlations.

### Techniques Used

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensured that the dataset was free from inconsistencies and ready for analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Provided a summary of the data to understand the central tendency and variability.
3. **Data Visualization**: Helped in identifying patterns and outliers in the data.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Assessed the relationship between session percentages and unit session percentages.

### Interpretations and Results

#### Key Insights

1. **High Unit Session Percentage**: Products with high unit session percentages indicate a high conversion rate, meaning visitors to the product page are likely to make a purchase.
2. **Low Session Percentage**: Products with low session percentages are not attracting much traffic, which could be due to poor visibility or unappealing listings.
3. **Actionable Tips**:
   - Products with a low session percentage but a high unit session percentage should be targeted for sponsored advertising to increase visibility.
   - Products with a high session percentage but a low unit session percentage should have their product listings improved to convert more visitors into buyers.

#### Recommendations

1. **Optimize Advertising**: Focus on promoting products with high conversion rates through paid advertising to maximize return on investment.
2. **Improve Product Listings**: Enhance the product information, images, and customer reviews for products with high traffic but low conversion rates to improve their performance.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of various products based on their session and unit session percentages. By leveraging these insights, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize their advertising strategies and improve product listings, ultimately driving higher sales and customer satisfaction.

By understanding and applying the insights from this analysis, recruiters and stakeholders can better appreciate the importance of data-driven decision-making in product management and marketing.
